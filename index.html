            <h2>Section 1: Backward</h2>
            <p>
                I was born the youngest child of four. As a small child I showed
                an interest in mathematics. My sister tought me algebra with
                chalk on the wallpaper by my bed when I was four, and instead of
                drawing animals or houses, I drew maps and patterns and time. I
                used to get distracted in math class by my own questions: how do
                multiplication tricks look in bases other than ten? What is zero
                times infinity? I would often get in trouble for arguing with my
                teachers.

            <h2>Section 2: Outward</h2>
            <p>
                I have a history of joining things in which I don't belong. I
                was a non-riding member of the equestrian team, a non-muslim
                member of the Muslim Student Association, I joined the Rowing
                Team in college having no sports experience (do we really want
                to count my time not riding horses?) and I became a physics
                major without ever having taken a physics class. As it turned
                out my enjoyment of physics didn't come close to that of pure
                math (), but the pattern here is that I say yes to experiences and
                learning new things, often at the cost of looking a little
                silly. It has always been worth it.

            <h2>Section 3: Inward</h2>
            <p>
                The pandemic really flipped my life inside out. I am a
                self-described violent flailing extrovert, but being on
                immunosuppressants meant I had to stay home, alone, for months.
                Sometimes I framed this as a fascinating challenge, and others I
                couldn't help but feel lonely and anchorless. Still, I
                benefitted. Apparently emotions can be felt in the body? Also,
                fierce boundaries reduce stress in the long term, improving
                health and happiness. Meditating is hard but cool
            </p>

            <h2>Section 4: Forward</h2>
            <p>
                The changes I made became my launch pad. With my mental health
                mostly in order and a clear set of questions (How should I pay
                for my life? How should I keep myself safe? What do I love? What
                can I give?), serendipity struck. I get to learn to code, which
                it turns out I love. (Well, I'm working at loving the frontend.)
                I get to solve puzzles and challenge myself and learn everyday.
                I never want to stop.
