                I was born in Ypsilanti, Michigan in 1990. I don't like to share
                the day because I dislike birthdays, but if you're glad I was
                born that's great anytime.
            </p>

                I was a mediocre student who always impressed her teachers in
                other ways- the norm for me was to fail to turn in my homework,
                only for the teacher to give me enough partial credit for
                finishing all of my missing work in a mad dash before the
                semester ended. Turns out I have ADHD, who would have guessed. I
                also forgot to eat lunch or breakfast for several years of my
                childhood. Oops!
            </p>
            <p>
                In college I was an art major, then a physics major, then
                finally a math major. I love what I learned but rarely get to
                use it-until now, that is. Programming feels like a natural
                place to exercise my logical chops, and, I now have a million
                more strategies for working with my ADHD brain.

                I have struggled with my health for about a decade, but I was
                finally diagnosed with Crohn's disease in 2018 and got treatment
                for what really ailed me. I still don't have the energy I wish I
                had, but more recently I have had barely any pain, and I'm so
                grateful to be able to say that. Living in a body is a lot of
                work.

                I have so many hobbies that I decided to put them in an table,
                rather than a paragraph:
