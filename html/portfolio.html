            <p>
                Here is a fun little project I started when I had very little
                Java experience- I didn't even know how to make objects yet! As
                bootcamp goes on I am making more and more of it work. It's
                taking a while because I'm getting so much homework.

            <h2>100 Prisoners Problem</h2>
            <p>
                This program is based on a problem first proposed by Danish
                computer scientist Peter Bro Miltersen in 2003. 100 numbered
                prisoners must find their own numbers in one of 100 drawers in
                order to survive. Here is a version of the problem by Philippe
                Flajolet and Robert Sedgewick:
            </p>
            <p>
                The director of a prison offers 100 death row prisoners, who are
                numbered from 1 to 100, a last chance. A room contains a
                cupboard with 100 drawers. The director randomly puts one
                prisoner's number in each closed drawer. The prisoners enter the
                room, one after another. Each prisoner may open and look into 50
                drawers in any order. The drawers are closed again afterwards.
                If, during this search, every prisoner finds his number in one
                of the drawers, all prisoners are pardoned. If just one prisoner
                does not find his number, all prisoners die. Before the first
                prisoner enters the room, the prisoners may discuss strategy â€”
                but may not communicate once the first prisoner enters to look
                in the drawers. What is the prisoners' best strategy?
            </p>
            <p>
                Because the nature of the problem is probabilistic, my program
                is for simulating many iterations of a particular strategy the
                prisoners could try, to see each strategy's statistical success
                rate. As with Yahtzee, this program is not finished yet because
                of all the bootcamp homework I've been doing.

            <h2>Are You the One? Solver</h2>
            <p>
                Are You the One? is a trashy romance reality tv show where 20
                singles who self identify as 'bad at relationships' undergo an
                array of psychological testing to be paired with their 'pErFeCt
                MaTcH' (according to, in my opinion questionable, relationship
                experts/show producers). All 20 are placed in a house for ten
                weeks to binge drink and wind surf and punch walls, all while
                trying to find their perfect match. Each episode they must guess
                ten matches, and they are told only the number of correct
                matches. If they all find their perfect matches before the end
                of the show, they split a cash prize.
            </p>
            <p>
                To kill time during lockdown, I figured out the correct set of
                matches multiple episodes before the contestants did. This
                program is to replace the spreadsheets and manual deduction I
                did on the first two seasons. It isn't finished yet (oh well, at
                least my grades are good), but when I have time, it will hold
                given data, deduce provable information, eliminate disprovable
                pairings, and allow me to add intuited guesses to have the best
                chance at predicting the correct solution early.
